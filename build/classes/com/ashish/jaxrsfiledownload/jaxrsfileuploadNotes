RESTful JAX-RS File Download Example:

We can download text files, image files, pdf files, excel files in java by JAX-RS API. 
To do so we need to write few lines of code only.
Here, we are using jersey implementation for developing JAX-RS file download examples.

(*)
You need to specify different content type to download different files. 
The @Produces annotation is used to specify the type of file content.

1. @Produces("text/plain"): for downloading text file.
2. @Produces("image/png"): for downloading png image file.
3. @Produces("application/pdf"): for downloading PDF file.
4. @Produces("application/vnd.ms-excel"): for downloading excel file.
