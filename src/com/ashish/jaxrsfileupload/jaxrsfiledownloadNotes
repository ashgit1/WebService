RESTful JAX-RS File Upload Example:
	
We can easily upload a file such as image file, pdf file, excel file, text file etc.
The @FormDataParam("file") annotation is used to mention file parameter in the service class. 
The @Consumes(MediaType.MULTIPART_FORM_DATA) is used to provide information of the file upload.

To upload file using JAX-RS API, we are using jersey implementation.
To upload file through jersey implementation, you need to provide extra configuration entry in web.xml file.

<init-param>  
     <param-name>jersey.config.server.provider.classnames</param-name>  
     <param-value>
     	org.glassfish.jersey.filter.LoggingFilter; 
     	org.glassfish.jersey.media.multipart.MultiPartFeature
     </param-value>  
</init-param>
